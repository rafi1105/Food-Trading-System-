Problem Domain:

1.In this system, both buying and selling price of the product will be given to 
us. so that the third party cannot increase the price of the product by creating 
a syndicate running in the market. [2]

2. Here, just as common buyers can see the price of goods, common traders 
can also see how much profit they can make if they buy the goods today at 
what price. In that regard, the import and export can take idea and accordingly 
they can buy the goods and the government will be aware that no party can 
syndicate the import and export system. [1]

3. Every day the government will control the reduction and increase in the 
price of all products. If anyone sells any product beyond the price set by the 
government, they can file a complaint in the system. [2]
